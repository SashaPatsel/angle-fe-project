## Structure



## Process notes
I was unable to get a response from the Docker image as set up in the instructions, so I handled all data management on the front end. 

All data and requests are formatted as outlined the API README though (aside from the filter and sorting "calls". There weren't great fits for either in the listed API calls, so I fed them whichever arguments were most convenient).
